# Personal-Task-Manager

ðŸ“– Project Overview
The Personal Task Manager is a JavaFX-based desktop application designed to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks.
It provides a clean and interactive graphical interface where users can add, view, edit, delete, and search tasks with ease.
Tasks are organized with attributes like title, description, due date, and priority, and can be marked as completed when finished.

To ensure data persistence, the application integrates with an SQLite database for permanent storage of tasks.
In addition, Gson is used to export and import tasks in JSON format, enabling easy backup and sharing of task data.
